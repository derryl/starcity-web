      <h4>Economy</h4>
      <p>Research indicates that the odds of rising to another income level are notably much higher in great cities. Simply put, the best cities foster the highest probability of economic success.</p>

      <h4>Ecology</h4>
      <p>Suburban sprawl is not good for the environment. City dwellers save 70% as much water and 30% less gasoline. Urban dwellers require fewer resources in sum than their suburban counterparts. We want to enable more people to live sustainably in urban environments.</p>

        <p>Building homes for everyone is really, really difficult; it involves navigating physical, capital, political and emotional pressures that are usually in conflict. As a result, not many people are working on this problem.</p>
        <p>We welcome this challenge because we don't want to lose the amazing character of the cities we love.</p>

        <h4>The forgotten middle</h4>
        <p>New supply of low income housing is made possible through government subsidies and public vouchers, and we all know that there's no shortage of luxury high-rises going up — but what about everyone in between?</p>
        <p>Our mission is to house the backbone of every city: the teachers, police officers, firefighters, hospitality workers, students and entrepreneurs, which in turn makes cities accessible to everyone.</p>

The same way Space-X revolutionized the cost structure of space travel, Starcity intends on transforming the cost and impact of building.</p>

        <h4>Increasing livable space and reducing waste</h4>
        <p>The lack of capital for middle-income developments also means that we, as a society, lack the ability to challenge assumptions about what the middle-income urban dweller needs and desires. How much private space do they need? What do they expect for community and neighborhood interaction? What tradeoffs are people willing to make to have a fulfilling urban experience? To answer these questions, Starcity is reimagining the physical spaces in which we live, with direct input from our members.</p>

        <h4 class="mt2">CEO &amp; Co-founder</h4>
        <p>Jon has lived in San Francisco since rent for an apartment was ~$1,000 (a long time ago). He grew up in Palo Alto, where his family fostered a communal lifestyle with people from around the world. They shacked up in the family’s cottage and developed a deep sense of (hippie) community spirit. At Starcity, Jon shapes company culture, finds and closes deals to grow Starcity's network of communal homes, identifies future growth opportunities, and handles public relations.</p>

At Starcity, Mo shapes the design aesthetic, manages software and physical product development, and works closely with our communities to address their needs.</p>

        <h4 class="mt2">COO &amp; Co-founder</h4>
        <p>Jesse lived in a communal house during his undergraduate days at UC Berkeley. There he learned the power of sharing resources and community interaction. Jesse was living in San Francisco until rent increases caused him to move east to Oakland. At Starcity, Jesse structures relationships with our many partners, handles financial operations, and spearheads recruitment.</p>

He now lives in Oakland, though he's often found with his camera in Golden Gate Park, taking photos of everyday San Franciscans. At Starcity, Josh builds all of our software and handles smart-home tech integrations for our communal homes.</p>

        <h4 class="mt2">VP of Community</h4>
        <p>Meg has lived in communal homes since she flew the family nest, and currently lives with 3 people in San Francisco. She discovered her penchant for nurturing community in college while working on a community arts magazine, and later learned how to design the built environment for it at a residential interior design firm. Meg honed the art of customer service as a general manager in the hospitality industry, and recently refined her community management skills by developing a coworking space in San Francisco. At Starcity, Meg facilitates the growth of the communities, leads the efforts to deliver exceptional member experiences, and contributes to brand and marketing efforts.</p>

        <h4 class="mt2">Product Acquisition & Development</h4>
        <p>JP believes that home should be a place where we can let our guard down, connect and recharge. With that in mind, in early 2013, he pioneered a shared-housing model that inspired him to leave a career in finance in order to pursue real estate investment and redevelopment opportunities in San Francisco and the greater Bay area. At Starcity JP focuses on asset acquisition and redevelopment. When he is not working he enjoys spending time with his wife and two young children, and riding motorcycles.</p>
